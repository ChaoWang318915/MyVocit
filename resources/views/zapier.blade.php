                <div class="ui small header">FEES</div>
                <p>The Vocit website operates and provides its services free of charge to independent users.
                    Business users, however, will be liable for a monthly subscription or a one-time payment for their use of the website. </p>
                <div class="ui small header">RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION</div>
                <p>All subscribed businesses agree and accept that the service shall be offered on a recurring subscription basis. This means that you will be charged through your original payment method the subscription fee for the next cycle on the anniversary of your first subscription.</p>
                <div class="ui small header">REFUNDS AND CANCELATIONS</div>
                <p>We do not, under any circumstances, offer refunds for subscriptions paid. The only recourse available to any business no longer interested in using our services is to cancel their subscriptions.
                    Where you chose to do this, you will still be able to use the services for the remaining duration of your subscription.</p>
                <div class="ui small header">HOW THE SERVICE WORKS</div>
                <p>Businesses who are registered on the website and who are up to date on their subscriptions are free to post requests for user-generated content requests from Vocit users on the website.

                    Users who see the request and desire to fulfill it may then contact the business to signify their interest in providing the user-generated content.
                </p>
                <div class="ui small header">ADDITIONAL TERM FOR INDEPENDENT USER</div>
                <p>In addition to the general terms and conditions, independent users agree and accept that:
                    The terms of this agreement make no provisions for full-time employment. A user shall remain an independent user and not an employee of Vocit;
                    We will not reward users with any type of compensation, besides the agreed-upon payment with the corresponding business who requests for user-generated content;

                    The content being provided to the business requesting it is relevant to the content request;
                    You have all the rights and approvals to provide such user content in such a manner.
                </p>
                <div class="ui small header">ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR BUSINESSES</div>
                <p>In addition to the general terms and conditions, businesses agree and accept:
                    To use the content for marketing and research purposes only;
                    To never share, sell, or give the content to a third party;
                    That we do not attest to, neither have we confirmed the ability of the independent user to produce and provide you with the requested user-generated content; and
                    To never alter or use the content in any way that would embarrass or harass the Vocit user.
                </p>
                <div class="ui small header">REWARDS</div>
                <p>You agree and accept that the performance of the reward associated with the request for any user-generated comment shall be the responsibility of the business/company that requested that user-generated comment, and not that of Vocit.

                    We will not be responsible for the performance of such a reward.
                    We do not, in any way, represent that the business has the power or authority to perform the reward it promised. We do not verify and are not under any obligation to verify the existence of the promised reward, or that the company has the power to perform such a reward.
                    We will, under no circumstances, be liable or responsible for the performance or non-performance of any reward.
                </p>
                <div class="ui small header">DISPUTE RESOLUTION BETWEEN INDEPENDENT USERS AND COMPANIES</div>
                <p>Where a dispute arises between an independent user and a business, Vocit may act as a mediator and may review any additional terms in a bid to resolve the dispute. We are, however, under no obligation, so act.

                    Notwithstanding the above, all independent users and businesses have the responsibility of resolving disputes amongst themselves, with or without our intervention. We will never be liable for the outcome of any such disputes.
                </p>
                <div class="ui small header">REVIEWS</div>
                <p>We use the feedback reviews provided by both independent users and businesses to rate our users’ performance. These reviews describe the total experience of independent users and businesses in the provision/procurement of user-generated content. All feedback reviews must come from legitimate orders executed exclusively through Vocit from users on the platform.

                <div class="ui small header">USER CONTENT</div>
                <p>You may, as a registered user of the website, submit and upload comments, in addition to any reviews that you give, on some portions of our website.  When you post any content or comment on the service, you automatically grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide, irreversible, continuous, unlimited and royalty-free license to distribute, transmit, publicly perform and/or display, and broadcast such content or comment in any media, medium or technology, or any manner or form known now or to be later developed, for the purpose of promoting our website and provided services.
